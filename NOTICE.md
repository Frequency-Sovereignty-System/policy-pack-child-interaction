It does not provide legal advice, does not constitute a compliance certification, and does not create any agency, partnership, fiduciary, or contractual relationship.

The author of this PolicyPack does not operate, control, design, execute, monitor, or enforce any system behavior.
All system design choices, implementations, enforcement actions, operational workflows, and resulting outcomes remain solely and entirely the responsibility of the implementing party.

Without limitation, implementers are responsible for:
- assessing and complying with jurisdiction-specific legal and regulatory obligations,
- system architecture, configuration, and enforcement workflows,
- monitoring, auditing, and incident response,
- user communications, disclosures, and reporting duties.

This PolicyPack highlights non-binding, illustrative reference considerations only, including:
- the use of human confirmation in high-risk contexts,
- data minimization and privacy-oriented design principles,
- implementer-side risk-reduction considerations regarding AI training and persona construction in child-related contexts.

Nothing in this PolicyPack should be interpreted as requiring adoption of any specific technical implementation, enforcement mechanism, or operational process.
