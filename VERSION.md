## Integrity Notes

- The primary reference file for this PolicyPack is `policy.json`.  
- Implementers may independently compute and record a SHA-256 hash of `policy.json` for their own verification, auditing, or integration records.  
- This PolicyPack is designed with the intent to preserve semantic stability across versions. Where updates occur, changes are expected to be additive where feasible. No ongoing maintenance, update, or support obligation is implied.
